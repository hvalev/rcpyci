\title{Computes Informational Value}
\usage{
computeInfoVal2IFC(target_ci, rdata, iter = 10000, force_gen_ref_dist = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_ci}{A classification image object (list-type) as returned by generateCI}

\item{rdata}{String pointing to .RData file that was created when stimuli were generated. This file contains the contrast parameters of all generated stimuli and possibly its corresponding reference distribution generated with generateReferenceDistribution().}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations for the simulation of the reference distribution (only used if reference distribution is not already pre-generated and present in rdata file)}

\item{force_gen_ref_dist}{Boolean specifying whether to override the default behavior to use pre-computed values for the reference distribution for specific task parameters and instead force to recompute the reference distribution (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Informational value (z-score)
}
\description{
Computes Informational Value for a single CI in a 2IFC task.
}
\details{
The Informational Value metric can be considered as a z-score that quantifies the signal
present in a classification image. The higher the Informational Value, the more signal. It is
possible to use a cut-off such as z = 1.96 to select classification images with significant
signal under alpha = 0.05.

Informational Value is computed by simulating random responding under identical task parameters to
an empirical dataset (called the reference distribution). The metric quantifies how unlikely it is
to observe these data under the null-hypothesis that there is no signal (i.e., that there is only random responding).

The simulation to compute the reference distribution takes a long time, and is only run locally when
pre-computed values for the reference distribution matching the stimulus set in the .Rdata file have
not been supplied by the rcicr package.
